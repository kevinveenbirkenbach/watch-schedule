# Watch-Schedule

Crafted by Kevin Veen-Birkenbach ([kevin@veen.world](mailto:kevin@veen.world), [veen.world](https://www.veen.world)), this software enables efficient watch scheduling for the SY-Amy2's voyage from Alicante to Korfu. Journey specifics can be accessed [here](https://www.sy-amy2.de/?p=64). Interestingly, it was developed amidst relatively calm seas, with waves less than 1.5m high, as we sailed and motored north of Alicante.

The software creates a sailing shift schedule, automatically pairing an experienced sailor with a novice sailor for each 3.5-hour shift. It provides timestamps in UTC, WEST, and CEST, and saves the final schedule in a CSV file for convenient viewing and usage. 

## Development
This project was developed with the assistance of Chat GPT from OpenAI. The conversation leading to the development of this software can be found [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/94c6eec2-6057-4a3a-a88d-c5a8cd18d883).

## Usage
