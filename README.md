# Watch-Schedule

This software was created by Kevin Veen-Birkenbach (kevin@veen.world, [veen.world](https://www.veen.world)) to manage the watch schedule for the turn of SY-Amy2 from Alicante to Korfu. More about the turn can be found [here](https://www.sy-amy2.de/?p=64).

The software creates a sailing shift schedule, automatically pairing an experienced sailor with a novice sailor for each 3.5-hour shift. It provides timestamps in UTC, WEST, and CEST, and saves the final schedule in a CSV file for convenient viewing and usage. 

## Development
This project was developed with the assistance of Chat GPT from OpenAI. The conversation leading to the development of this software can be found [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/94c6eec2-6057-4a3a-a88d-c5a8cd18d883).
